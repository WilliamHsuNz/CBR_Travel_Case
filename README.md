# CBR_Travel_Case
This repository contains an implementation of a Case-based reasoning system for the travel domain.  The system uses the k-Nearest-Neighbour (k-NN) algorithm to retrieve the 10 most similar cases in the case-base based on the user's query.  

To run the system, the local machine must have Python 3.5 package Tkinter (Python's defacto GUI pacakge) and library xlrd (for extracting data from a Microsoft Excel Spreadsheet) installed and set up.  Once the above has been setup, use commandline to set the working directory to the location of the folder CBR_Travel_Case.  Use the following command to run:

$ python3 CBR_Travel.py
